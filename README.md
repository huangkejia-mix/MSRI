This is a new algorithm for outdoor Vector Spatial Data Matching Based on Distance Attenuation, including the code for implementing methods, test code and all of the test data results, 

We have submitted a vector space data matching minimum spatial residual iterative algorithm based on distance attenuation in this repository, which can be widely used for multi-sensor and multi-source heterogeneous spatial data fusion.
